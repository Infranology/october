This is the NineSixty theme <http://drupal.org/project/ninesixty> developed as
a Zen sub theme for use with Zen theme <http://drupal.org/project/zen>.

This theme is only for Drupal 6.


INSTALLATION
------------

- Download Zen Theme for Drupal 6 version (http://drupal.org/project/zen) and
  unzip this theme into sites/all/themes/

- The Zen theme is the based theme that must be installed to have this sub theme
  work properly.

- Now unzip this theme (october) and place it in your theme directory, so
  directory path should look like: sites/all/themes/october

- Login as admin and go to Administer > Site building > Themes and enable
  '960 Grid System (Zen sub theme)' theme (admin/build/themes)

- You can configure the theme settings. To do this click on 'configure' link
  next to the theme in the theme listing page.


WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN THIS THEME COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL NINESIXTY THEME
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- It inherits all the theme settings from the Zen theme (ie inline block
  editing).

- Added Debug mode (showing grid on the page) as a theme setting so you can
  enable/disable it in the theme settings
  (admin/build/themes/settings/october).

- Additional region added: 'content top' and 'content bottom' so blocks can be
  assigned to the top or bottom of the main content area.
